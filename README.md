This is my submission for the mid term exam for Binus Universities' model deployment course. 
It is a deployment of a model for predicting whether or not a customer of a bank will churn or not based on certain features (e.g. credit score, age). The app is deployed using Streamlit which is
a way to deliver an interactive application designed for fast deployment.
